2. coetus antelucanos. The Holy Eucharist was celebrated at
these early morning assemblies, as we learn from an interesting
passage de Coo-on. 3, ‘ Eucharistiae sacramentum, et in tempore victus
et omnibus mandatum a Domino, etiam antelucanis coetibus, nec de
aliorum manu quam Praesidentium sumimus,’ etc.

3. Christo ut Deo. This is the true reading, not ‘ et Deo, ’as anine-

stood the Christian worship. A passage in an ancient writer, probably
Hippolytus or Caius (apud Euseb. v. 28), is equally clear in showing
that the early Christian hymns celebrated the Deity of Christ: ψαλμοὶ
δὲ ὅσοι καὶ ᾠδαὶ ἀδελφῶν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ὑπὸ πιστῶν γραφεῖσαι τὸν Λόγον τοῦ
Θεοῦ τὸν Χριστὸν ὑμνοῦσι θεολογοῦντες. Gomp. Origen contr. Cels. viii.

5. rescripsit. On the technical use of this word see note ch. 4.
Tertullian’s criticism here of Trajan’s ruling is strictly a piece of
forensic pleading: he leaves out of sight· the fact that the profession
of Christianity was a criminal offence previous to the emperor's rescript.
In reality Trajan's action was a moderate and statesmanlike policy of
repression without persecution of what he probably considered was a
dangerous political association. In ch. 5 Tertullian himself claims it
as a sort of check upon the officious enforcement of the earlier laws.

6. oblatos ε ‘if brought up before the magistrates ' ι offerri has this
sense below, and oblatio is the corresponding substantive.
