5 CAPUT X.

Duos, inquitis, non colitis, et pro imperatoribus sacrificia
non impenditis. Sequitur ut eadem ratione pro aliis non
sacrificemus, quia nec pro nobis ipsis, semel deos non colendo.
Itaque sacrilegii et majestatis rei convenimur. Summa haec

6. Deos, inquitis, non colitis. Tertullian now takes up the two
main charges brought against the Christians‚ Sacrilege and Disloyalty.
The consideration of the first accusation occupies ch. 10—27 ; of the
second ch. 28-38. The charge of sacrilege was based upon the grounds
that the Christiane neglected the prescribed worship of the gods, and
that they had no temples or sacrifices: comp. Lactant. ii. 23 Min.
Felix 103 and the sentence under which S. Gyprian was condemned,
Acta procons. 4, ‘ diu sacrilega mente vixisti . . . et inimicum te diis
Romanis et sacris legibus constituisti.’

7. pro aliis non sacrificemus. Tertullian is referring to sacrifices
in the heathen conception of them: elsewhere he agrees with all the
early Fathers in regarding the Holy Eucharist as the Christian Sacri-
fice: de orat. 19 pass, ; de cult. fem. ii. 11, ‘ sacrificium offertur, aut
Dei verbum administratur'3 comp. J ustin Mart. dial. c. Tryph. 41.
See SACRIFIOE in Diet. Chr. Ant„ and a suggestive chapter in
Maclear’s Evidential valae of H. Euclc„ Part i. ch. 3. pp. 45 ff.

9. majestatis: sc. laesae: ch. 28, ‘laesae augustioris majestatis?
The early Roman law against treason (perduellio) had been extended
in its application by various enactments until, in the time of Tiberius
(when the sacredness‚ theoretically ascribed to the state, had become
attached to the person of the emperor), any act which tended to bring
the commonwealth, the laws, or the emperor into contempt was pun-
ishable under the charge of majestas. The professors of Christianity
were liable under the Julian law of majestas, as members of an illicit
combination 3 and, more obviously, as bad subjects who refused the
customary acts which betokened loyalty to the emperor and compliance
with the laws ; see below, ch. 28 ι and on the law of treason‚ Merivale
Hist. Rom. v. 247 ff. ’

convenimur: ‘ we are judicially accused’; this forensic use of
convenire recurs frequently, e. 9. ch. 28, 31, 35 3 ad Nat. i. 17. ⁴

ιο. praesumptio: lit. ‘a hasty decision on insufficient evidence‚’
