Cu. XXV.] adversus Gentes pro Christianis. 9 5·

ferendi imperii tenent potestatem, cum ipsi regnarent, a
quibus acceperant eam gratiam‘l quem coluerat Saturnus et
J upiter‘l aliquem opinor Sterculium [sed Romae postea]‚
cum indigenis suis. Etiam si qui non regnarunt, tamen

regnabatur ab aliis nondum cultoribus suis, ut qui nondum 5

dii habebantur. Ergo aliorum est regnum dare, quia regna-
batur multo ante quam isti dii inciderentur.

Sed quam vanum est fastigium Romani nominis religio-
sitatis meritis deputare, cum post imperium sive adhuc
regnum [auctis jam rebus] religio profecerit. Nam etsi
a Numa concepta est curiositas superstitiosa, nondum tamen

reigned? Whom did your gods once worship? Some Sterculius, I
suppose, in order to be honoured at Rome. Even if some of the gods
did not reign, yet there were rulers who did not worship them,
simply because they did not then exist as gods. It is not therefore
in the power of your gods to confer empire‚ for empires existed prior
to them.’

3. [sed Romae postea] The MSS. vary and the passage is pro-
bably corrupt. The meaning is that some Roman god like Sterculius
had to be afterwards honoured by the gods at Rome (in order to win
the worship of the Romans) along with their own native deities, who
had previously conferred sovereignty upon them elsewhere.

7. inciderentur: ‘were inscribed‚' as gods on their statues and
images. Comp. ch. 50, ‘statuas defunditis et imagines inscribitis et
titulos inciditis?

8. Sed quam vanum est. Another point is now taken up: ‘the
grandeur of your empire cannot be the reward of your religious
scrupulosity, for your elaborate religion is of later growth than your
empire.’

fastigium . . . deputare : ‘ to attribute the dignity of the Roman
name to the deserts of piety '; see notes on deputare, ch. 20, 21.

10. Nam etsi a Numa. This is another aryamentwm ad hominem.

The wealth of religious ceremonial in Tertullian's day is urged as
a proof of greater piety than existed in the early days of Rome, when
the worship of the gods was conducted in a humbler style. Tertullian
is not seriously arguing that the depth of national piety is proportioned
to the national wealth; though as a. matter of fact where wealth and
piety co-exist, the necessary forms by which the latter is expressed
will naturally be embellished by the former. Comp. Cic. de nat. deor.
iii. 17. 43.

11. curiositas A rare word: it is used de praescr. haer. 7, ‘nobis
curiositate opus non est post Christum J esum'3 and ib. 14, in the
sense of ‘inquisitivenesa’ Here itx means ‘superstitious assiduity,’
