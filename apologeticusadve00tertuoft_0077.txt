sumptio aut iniquitas judicet, altera quae desperat, altera
quae recusat veritatem. Deos vestros colere desinimus, ex
quo illos non esse cognoscimus. Hoc igitur exigere debetis,
uti probemus non esse illos deos, et idcirco non colendos,
quia tunc demum coli debuissent, si dii fuissent. Tunc et5
Christiani puniendi, si quos non colerent, quia putarent non
esse, constaret illos deos esse.

Sed nobis, inquitis, dii sunt. Appellamus et provocamus

‘ prejudice' ; and so used ch. 49: here in a similar wa)r of the philo·
sophie cynicism which asks ‘ Quid est veritas' 2 despairing of its ac—

term of reproach against the Christiane like dementia, obstinatio, etc. ;
comp. ad Nat. i. 19 ; de test. anim. 4.

2. Deos vestros colere desinimus. Theii consciousness of the
falsity of the heathen gods impelled the Christians to go further and
directly assail the worship of them: J ustin Mart. Apol. i. 5. Hence
the popular outcry ‘ Tolle sacrilegos ' l ‘ Christiani non sint ’ς Αἶρε τοὺς
ἀθέους. Mart. S. Polyc. 9 ; Euseb. iv. 15 3 comp. Acts xxii. 22. As early

Origen, LactantiuS, and Arnobius: see Gibhon ii. 225 ; and Merivale
Hist. Rom. vii. 381, that it was ‘ the last refuge of declining Paganism,
and showed a fear of Christianity which had never been excited by
J udaism!

5. Tunc et: introducing a logical sequence: ‘ and then it will
follow, of course, that the Christians too must be punished, if . . .'

8. Sed nobis inquitis, dii sunt. Tertullian anticipates and
answers three pleas put forward by his opponents, of which this is
the first. ‘The gods are gods to us, though you may be indifferent to
their claims.' It is taken up again ch. 13. Here Tel-tullian contents
himself with an appeal to the heathen conscience to deny, if it can,
that the pagan gods were originally mortal men. This leads up to the
' consideration of the second heathen plea in the next chapter.

Appellamus et provocamus. These are technical juridical
terms for ‘ carrying an appeal to a higher¹ court? ‘ We protest and
appeal from yourselves to your consciences.' ⁴
