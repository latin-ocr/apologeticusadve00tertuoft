Introduction. ⁴ xvii

saluted Augustus *at Antioch‚ and was acknowledged by the
East and by Egypt. But his soldiers were no match sor the
legions of Severus. Successive defeats at Cyzicus, Nicaea,
and near the Issus crushed his cause, and he was finally
captured and ’beheaded at Antioch in 194. Byzantium alone
remained in the hands of Niger's party, and for more than
two years it withstood a severe siege.

Meanwhile Severus was occupied with wars in Arabia and
Mesopotamia, during which he concluded a treaty with
Abgarus, King of Edessa, who assisted him with forces. On
the fall of Byzantium in 196 Severus hurried westward to
meet the ambitious Albinus who had assumed the title of
Augustus, and had crossed into Gaul. Albinus was finally
defeated and slain in the plain of Trevoux near Lyon on
February 19, 197. Severus returned to Rome, and after
inflicting capital punishment upon numbers of Albinus'
adherents, set out again for the East against the Parthians
who had invaded Mesopotamia. He remained in the East
for some years, passing through Syria and Egypt and in-
vestigating the remnants of Niger's faction. Albinus and
Niger are mentioned Apoloyy 35, and probably the Parthian
expedition of Severus is alluded to ib. 37 ; but Tertullian at the
time of writing the APOLOGY apparently knew nothing *of the
edict of Severus in 202 which forbade the Jews and Christians
to make proselytes1 ; otherwise he would almost certainly
have referred to it when describing the laws whose authority
was invoked against the Christians (Apol. 4, 5; see notes).

III. The date of the APOLOGY, then, falls between the
overthrow of Albinus in February, 197, and the rescript of
Severus in 202, with a preference for the earlier year.

The treatise was addressed to the proconsul and governors
