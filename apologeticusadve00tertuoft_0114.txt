76 Tertulliani A polegeticus [Cn. X X 1.

a matrice non recessit, sed excessit. Iste igitur Dei radius,
ut retro semper praedicabatur, delapsus in virginem quamdam,
et in utero ejus caro figuratus, nascitur Homo Deo mistus.
Caro spiritu instructa nutritur, adolescit, affatur, docet,
5 operatur, et CHRISTUS ests
Recipite interim hanc fabulam, similis est vestriS, dum
ostendimus quomodo Christus probetur. Sciebant et qui
penes vos ejusmodi fabulas aemulas ad destructionem veritatis
istiusmodi praeministraverunt. Sciebant et J udaei venturum
10 esse Christum, scilicet quibus prophetae loquebantur. Nam
et nunc adventum ejus exspectant, nec alia magis inter nos
et illos compulsatio est, quam quod jam venisse non credunt.

in the Trinity which follows from the Father being the Fount of God-
head. See Bright, serm. of S. Leo, note 89 ; comp. adv. Praae. l. e.

non statu, ‘ not in condition of being.’ Comp. adv. Praae. 4.
In effect non statu asserts coequality.

2. praedicabatur. Isaiah vii. 14.

3. Homo Deo mistus t ‘ man united to God’3 miscere recurs in this
sense ch. 393 adv. Maro. ii. 27, ‘ miscente in semetipso Hominem et
Deum.’ This was the usual expression of the early Latin Fathers for
the Union of the Two Natures in Christ, corresponding to κρᾶσις (and
its compounds) of the Greek Fathers. As used by them this phrase-
ology was perfectly orthodox ; e. 9. S. Cyprian de. idol. van. 11 ; Orig.
contr. Cels. iii. 41; Lactant. iv. 133 S. Athan. Orat. e. Ar. iv· 333
contr. Apol. ii. 16 (Lib. Fath. Later Treat. p. 138); and even later by
S. August. Ep. 137. 11 ; S. Greg. Naz. Ep. 101. 103 S. Greg. Nyss.
Cat. 273 S. Leo serm. 23. 1 (Bright’s transl. note 9); comp. S. Cyr-
Alex. adm. Nest. i. 3. But the terms were subsequently abused by
heresy and invested with a technical heretical meaning3 and it then
became necessary to restrict the Catholic phraseology to exactly defined
expressions. Thus ’ἐνωσις καθ’ ὑπόστασιν, unitio, were the orthodox
terms by which the Personal Union was expressed, and the heretical
expressions were disclaimed: κρᾶσις as Apollinarian; συναφεῖα, associ-
atio, as Nestorian3 σύγχυσις, commixtio, as Eutychian. See Liddon
Bampt. Leet. vii. pp. 426 ff.

6. Recipite interim: interim is here as in ch. 8, credite interim,

‘for the time being,’ till we finish the argument.
7. Sciebant: ‘ were aware of what was to come to pass!
qui penes vos . . . praeministraverunt, i. e. the daemons who
anticipated the truth with rival fables to destroy it; see ch. 22, and
above, notes on ch. 2 : comp. Cyr. J er. Oatech. xv. 11.
12. compulsatio, ‘fierce contention.’
