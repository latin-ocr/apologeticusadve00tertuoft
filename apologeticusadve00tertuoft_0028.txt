CHAPTER XIII. You dishonour them alike by your multiplicatiori of

their number, by your shameless traffic in them,

and by the character of those whom you admit to
their company.

cule them in your literature.

XV. You deride them in your theatres, and pollute their
temples by the committal of the grossest sinu. Itis,
in fact, you yourselves who are guilty of sacrilege,

and not we Christiane, who never enter your temples.

, XVI. After refuting certain erroneous ideas I will set forth

the main features of our religion.

We do not worship an ass’s head. You worship all
kinds of beasts and cattle.

If you assert that we pay homage to the cross, you
must plead guilty to the same charge.

If we were worshippers of the sun we should only re-
semble the Persians3 and our observance of Suu-day
is met by your observance of Saturn’s day.

Your latest calumny about us is the monstrous ‘ ass-
born deity of the Christians ;' a monstrosity which
you surely might well worship: we only smile at
the absurdity. '

„ XVII. We worship One God, the Creator of the universe,

invisible and incomprehensible, to whom nature and
the human conscience witness.

„ XVIII. Who, for our fuller and closer approach to Himself, gave

us His written word, and sent us inspired teachers.

, XIX. The authority of the scriptures is vindicated by their

antiquity, which is higher than that of any heathen
record.

XX. Their majesty ⁴and divinity are obvious: history has
fulfilled, and is daily fulfilling, what they foretell.

, ΧΧΙ. The Jews regarded Christ as a mere man3 we acknow·

ledge Him as the Incarnate Son of God, who lived a
wonderful life, and was crucified, as He Himself
and the prophets foretold. After His death He
rose again on the third day and finally ascended
into heaven. If His Divinity be true, all other re·
ligions must be false.

„ XXII. There are e'vil spirits called daemons, who work evil

amongst men, and deter them from coming to the
knowledge of the True God. ’
