i. 7); but it does not appear whether this was before or ’

after his conversion. It may be that Tertullian went to
Rome as a presbyter, and whilst there openly professed his
attachment to the “New Prophecy,' subsequently returning
to Carthage. His acquaintance with the details of the
action taken by the Roman church with regard to Marcion
and Valentinus (de praescr. haer. 30) does not necessarily
imply any long stay in Rome3 and it seems clear from ex-
pressions in his writings that Carthage was his usual place
of residence (de pall. 13 Apol. 9; de ‘rea carn. 423 scorp.
63 comp. Optatus adv. Parmenian. 13 ‘ Praedestinatus’ de
haer. 26).

The date of Tertullian’s death cannot be determined with
certainty, but modern criticism in adopting the year 240
agrees with the report mentioned by S. J erome that he
lived to extreme old age (usque ad decrepitam aetatem).
His literary activity was enormous: his extant treatises
number upwards of thirty„and half of these were composed
within the brief space of three or four years (197-200). It
is, happily, unnecessary in this short introduction to the
APOLOGY to enter into the vexed question of the order and
dates of Tertullian's other works, or to enlarge upon the
heresy of Montanus, inasmuch as the APOLOGY was written,
perhaps while Tertullian was still a layman--at all events
before the mind of the great Latin Father became tainted
with the Phrygian fanaticism ¹.

in detail, to place the Carthaginian Church of Tertullian's
