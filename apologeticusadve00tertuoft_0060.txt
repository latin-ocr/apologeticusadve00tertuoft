22 Tertulliani A pologetz‘cus [cst. V.

quas Trajanus ex parte frustratus est vetando inquiri Chris-
tianos, quas nullus Hadrianus, quanquam curiositatum om-
nium explorator, nullus Vespasianus, quanquam J udaeorum ’
debellator, nullus Pius, 'nullus Verus impressit. Facilius

5 utique pessimi ab optimis quibusque, ut ab aemulis, quam a
suis sociis eradicandi judicarentur.

1. quas 'I'rajanus ex parte frustratae. However illogical the
decision of Trajan might be in strict law (above, ch. 2) its ruling was
on the whole generous towards the Christians. Christianity had
always been illegal: Trajan reaffirmed the fact, but forbade its pro-
fessore to be sought out or to be anonymously accused. They were

regardetli as criminals, but placed in a better position than ordinary
cmmma s.

2. Hadrianus. Hadrian, the dilettante philosopher and art-patron,
issued a rescript (preserved by J ustin Martyr Apol. i. 90, and quoted
by Euseb. iv. 8, 9) in ΑΔ). 124, of similar purport to the letter of Trajan
to Pliny. It was addressed to Minucius Fundanus the proconsul of ,
Asia, and was intended to secure for the Christiane a formal trial and
to protect them from slanderous informers.

quanquam curiositatum, ete. On the inquisitive and versatile
character of Hadrian see Spartian. Hadr. 1, 2, 13 ff · Aurel. Victor
Epit. 143 Eutrop. viii. 73 Euseb. H. E. v. 5. See Merivale Hist.
Rom. viii. 182 ff.

3. Vespasianus. Early Christian authors areA wsslanimous· in as- 'UA-'⁹53⁹
serting that no persecution was directed against Athe Christiana by s amu... sl
Vespasian (A..D 69-79) or by his son Titus (79-81). Comp. Euseb. ὦ
iii. 17, Δεύτερος [z. e. Domitian] δῆτα τὸν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἀνεκίνει διωγμόν,
καίπερ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Οὐεσπασιανοῦ μηδὲν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἄτοπον ἐπινοή-
σαντος.

4. Pius. Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161) is generally admitted to
have shown a leniency to the Christians which was an advance‘upon
the action of Hadrian3 but his edicts to the people of Larissa, Thfflsa-
Ionica, Athens, and to the Greeks generally, in favour of the Christiane
mentioned by Melito of Sardis (apud Euseb. iv. 26), are not extant.
See the Introduction, p. xiv. For his conduct as a prince see Marcus
Aurelius Medit. i. 6 3 Capitol. Ant. Pius 2, 7.

Verus. Either Lucius Verus, who may have taken no part in
the persecuting policy of his colleague‚ or Marcus Aurelius Verus
himself, whose attitude towards the Christiane Tertullian so strangely
misrepresents; see note above, rotsstorem Ξδθνθτιιε’ is the reading
of Mario—218. :t ww· ·1-..›.¹ ίίΙ ² 424⁴

impressit. Absol. ‘sanctionedss ‘put into operation' The me-

taphor is probably taken from sealing, and therefore countenancing
with one' s authority.
