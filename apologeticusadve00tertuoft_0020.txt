40). The hostility of paganism, though in one sense legally
fostered, in its practical issue was little more than mob-law,

and recked little of legal form, proceeding to condemn upon ’

mere rumour and uncorroborated slander (Apol. 7, 37).
Checked or abetted by the leniency or antagonism of local
magistrates (ad Scap. 4), furious attacks upon the Christians
were of constant recurrence, as the bitter eries of the
Apologists testify.

The period of quiet enjoyed by the Christians on the

by acknowledging him as Caesar. Didius Julianus was
promptly beheaded (June 2), and Severus turned his attention
to the more serious opposition in the East. Niger had been
