1. Nonne et ipsius Lycurgi. So again ch. 46, where ‘inedia de
semetipso judicarit’ is represented by ‘ ἀποκαρτέρησιν optavit.’ But
the account given by Plutarch (vit. Lycuryi) states that the reason for
Lycurgus’ suicide lay in his desire to preserve the inviolability of his
laws, the excellence of which he had been assured of by the Delphic
oracle‚ and to the observance of which until his return he had bound the
Spartans by oath.

5. silvam . . . caeditis. A proverbial expression recurring de praescr.
haer. 37 ; silva, like the Greek ὕλη, being used metaphorically for copia,
materia.

principalium rescriptorum. Rescriptum became the technical
expression for the imperial decisione upon questions submitted for so-
lution3 e.9. the case of the Christians in Bithynia referred by Pliny to
Trajan; ch. 2, ‘ tunc Trajan rescripsit.’ These ‘ rescripts,' termed prin-
cipum mandata, ch. 2, were registered as formal legislative enact-
ments3 see Merivale Hisc. Rom. iii. 464 ff. Principaliam, from the
special meaning attached to princeps, here and generally in late prose
writers (Suetonius, Tacitus, Pliny, Velleius) = ‘imperiaL’

7. Papias leges. The Papian law (lex Papia Poppaea, Tacit. Αηη.
iii. 25), proposed by Augustus A.U.c. 762, was a more stringent re-en-
actment of the Julian law of the same emperor, A.U.c. 736. It laid
heavier disabilities upon celibates and granted greater privileges to
the married. The absurd discrepancy between them to which Tert.
, refers (vanissimas) lay in the permission given under the Julian law
to men and women of twenty-five and twenty respectively to remain ’
unmarried, whereas by the Papian law penalties were imposed upon
those who were childless at that age. Sozom. H. Ε. i. 9 3 Tert. de monog„
16. The laws were repealed by Constantine in A.D. 320 out of regard
for religious celibacy, Euseb. Vit. Consi. iv. 26; Codex Justin. vii.
16. 1.

8. post tantae auctoritatis senectutem. Among the Romans
antiquity was the gange of sanctity. Tertullian uses this sentiment
as the basis of an argument, ch. 19, ‘Apud vos quoque religionis est
instar fidem de temporibus asserere.’

9. Severus constantissimus principum. Tert. has a word of
