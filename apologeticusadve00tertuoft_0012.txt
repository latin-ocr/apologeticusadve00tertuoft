viii Introduction.

Ι. The date of Tertullian’s conversion has been variously
placed between the years 185 and 196 ¹. ΤΙιθ earlier year
accords with the words of S. J erome, cum usque ad mediam

aetatem presbyter Ecclesiae permansisset, which may be ⁷

understood to imply a somewhat lengthy presbyterate3 but
it does not appear likely that a man of Tertullian's polemical
zeal would have remained silent for twelve years—and the
APOLOGY cannot be dated earlier than 197—before lifting
pen to vindicate from the injustice of ignorant and malicious
attack the religion he had embraced. It was most probably
at Carthage, his native home, that he became a convert to
Christianity, and he was soon admitted to the priesthood.
Not many years could have passed, however, before he was
attracted by the opinions of Montanus and his ready pen
engaged in their defence. According to S. J erome, Ter-
tullian’s lapse was immediately due to jealousy and affronts
put upon him by the Roman clergy (invidia et contumeliis
clericorum Romanae ecclesiae) 3 but there must also have been
a predisposition in the constitutional severity of the impulsive
African which rendered him impatient of any toleration of
laxity, and to which the stricter discipline enjoined by
Montanus potently appealed. That Tertullian visited Rome

adopts the view that Tertullian was for a time an eminent jul-ist at
Rome, and is inclined to identify with the Latin Father an otherwise
unknown Tertullian mentioned in the index to the Pandects as the
author of two works on Roman jurisprudence. He adds, Tertullian's
‘ activity as a jurist at Rome must fall within the period of Commodus;
for there is no indication in his writings that he was in Rome in the
time of Marcus Aurelius, and many passages seem to preclude the
supposition.' The dates suggested by Prof. Hamack for the facts of
Tertullian’s life are: Birth cir. 1505 Conversion while at Rome eir.
190-1953 Settled at Carthage and wrote Apology‚ 1973 Attracted by
Montanism, 202-203; Open breach with the Church, 207-208.
