quale de illicitis factionibus timeri solet. Nisi fallor enim,
prohibendarum factionum caussa de providentia constat
modestiae publicae, ne civitas in partes scinderetur, quae
res facile comitia, concilia, curias, contiones, spectacula
etiam aemulis studiorum compulsationibus inquietaret, cum 5
jam et in quaestu habere coepissent venalem et mercenariam
homines violentiae suae operam. At enim nobis ab omni
gloriae et dignitatis ardore frigentibus nulla est necessit-as
coetus, nec ulla magis res aliena, quam publica. Unam

by law. Amongst such Tertullian asks that the Christian body, as a
harmless and beneficent association, should be enrolled3 but the first
approach towards any action of the kind did not take place until A, D.
261, under Gallienus3 Euseb. Η. Ε. viii. 13. In the term factio Tert.
probably adopts the language of his heathen opponents3 comp. Min.
Fel. 8, ‘ homines deploratae illicitae ac desperatae factionis ’ ; and the
sentence pronounced by the proconsul Galerius on S. Cyprian, Aeta
procons. 4, ‘ plurimos nefariae tibi conspirationis homines aggregasti.'
See Gore, Christian Ministry, p. 31.

4. spectacula . . . compulsationibus. The rival factions of the
, circus were not seldom the cause of danger-ous riots in Rome, and were
always liable to issue in bloody encounters, such as that of the blues
and greens at Constantinople, A. D. 532 ; see Gibbon V. 48 ff. ; comp.
de spect. 9.

7. At enim nobis ab omni gloriae. The question of the law-
fulness of a Christian accepting the duties of civil magistracy is dis-
cussed by Tert. de idol. 17, ‘Hinc proxime disputatio suborta est, an
servus Dei alicujus dignitatis aut potestatis administrationem capiat,'
eto. The duties attaching to such dignities were in many cases idol-
atrous‚ and the badges of office savoured of pomp and vanity3 see de
spect. 12, ⁶ quaesturas dico et magistratus . . . cum tamen nominis dig—
nitas idololatriae crimine teneatur,' ete. Comp. below, ch. 46, ‘ the
Christian aspires not even to the aedileship,’ a despised office open
to the ranks. Military service was not forbidden, see ch. 5, 37,
42, ‘vobiscum et militamus? Yet contrast de coron. 11 ; de pall. 5.
See Pressense ii. 70 ff. on the difficulties encountered by the Christian
in public and private life.

8. nulla est necessitas coetus. ⁸ There is no necessity for us, who
are dead to all desire for glory or greatness, to form coalitions ; nor is
anything more foreign to our ideas than public life.' Combinations
and conspiracies are connected with new and strange religions in the
address of Maecenas to Augustus, Dion Cass. lii. 36.

9. Unam omnium . . . mundum. Christianity claimed to be uni·
versal, and the Christian, unlike his heathen opponent, was fettered by
no ties of local or racial religion. The Christians were in one sense
