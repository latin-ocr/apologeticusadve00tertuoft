Synopsis. xxvii

to the sanctiens of morality which your laws
necessarily lack.

CHAPTER XLVI. We have answered all the charges against us,
and established the truth and beneficence of
our religion. Incredulity, however, still de-
nies the divinity of our faith, and charges it
with being merely a school of philosophy, If
it be so, why are we not treated with the
same leniency as the philosophers‘! Philo—
sophers, though guilty, are acquitted on both
counts—-sacrilege and disloyalty ; why is not
the same privilege extended to usZ As a
matter of fact we differ from the philosophers
both in knowledge and morals.

XLVII„ Philosophers have borrowed ideas from the scrip-
tures, which are older than all systems of phi-

losophy, and have distorted them, as heretics
have corrupted the Truth delivered by Christ.

XLVIII. We are derided and tortured for teaching the
resurrection of the body3 yet the philosophie
argument for the transmigration of souls is
equally valid for oar contention, which is
also justified by many analogies in nature-
We ourselves shall rise again, clothed upon
with the proper substance of eternity‚ but the
wicked will endure the punishment of eternal
fire.

XLIX. You applaud these opinions as philosophical
speculations, but as articles of Christian be-
lief you deride them. Yet they are of prac-
tical utssity, and, even if mistaken‚ are inno-
cent and do not merit punishment. Besides,
this very power of inflicting punishment upon
us you enjoy solely at our own will and
pleasure.

L. We are willing to suffer because even in our
death we win a victory for the Truth. Wit-
nessed in others inflexible resolve and courage
gain your applause‚ in us your hatred.

Proceed, then, in your unjust crueltyt' our
steadfastness under persecution attracts new
converts. Gondemned by you, we stand
acquitted by God.
