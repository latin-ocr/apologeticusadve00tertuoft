TERTULLIAN (Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus)
was born in Carthage of heathen parentage about 160 Aa).
The exact date of his birth and the names of his parents
are unknown, but his father, we learn from S. J erome ¹,
filled the office of a proconsular centurion, and without
doubt he provided for his son a liberal education. That
Tertullian as a youth did not fail to make use of his
advantages is abundantly manifest from the strikingly wide
range of allusion and reference noticeable in his works‚
and particularly in the ΑΡοιοθῩ, DE PALLIO, and DE
CORONA2. Eusebius (H. Ε. 11. 2) speaks of his intimate
knowledge of Roman law and of his reputation as a Latin
writer33 and the statement of Trithemius (de script. eccles.)
that Tertullian was for many years a distinguished rheto-
rician at Carthage seems intrinsically probable. Certainly
his learning and powerful intellect, combined with his
brilliant and incisive eloquence‚ compelled the admiration
of men like S. Jerome, S. Augustine‚ and S. Vincent of
Lerins ⁴.

³ So Rufinus understood Eusebius’ words, τοὺς Ῥωμαίων νόμους
ἠκριβωκὼς ἀνήρ, τά τε ἄλλα ἔνδοξος, καὶ τῶν μάλιστα ἐπὶ Ῥώμης λαμπρῶν,
vir et legum et institutionum Romanoa-um peritissimus, et inter nostros
scriptores admodum clarus (Valesius).
