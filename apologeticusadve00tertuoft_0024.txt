can hardly be better summarized and contrasted than by
setting side by side the forcible canon of the ‘ Fourth

Oouncil of Carthage‚’ (can. 16), ‘A bishop should not read ’

the books of the Gentiles‚’ and the noble comment of the
ecclesiastical historian Socrates on 1 Thess. v. 21, ‘ What
is good, wherever it may be, is the property of the Truth‚’
(H. E. iii. 16). For the Church at large could not afford to
lay aside so useful a weapon of defence as was ready to her
hand in the intimate knowledge of classic writings such as
many of her strongest champions possessed3 while her· most
successful apologists—even those who most decried it—were
all brought up in, and had gained their dialectic skill from, a
classical education. ,

The APOLOGY of Tertullian, then, reflecting the African
temperament, is not merely a defenoe of Christianity, but
also an attack upon Paganism. It consists, indeed, primarily

(e. g. ch. 17-23) are introduced 3 but, as an integral part of
the discussion, paganism and heathen morality are denounced.

part of Tertulliau’s plan to produce a complete system of
Christian evidences‚ or to set out in detail the whole
doctrine and worship of the Catholic Ghurch (comp. Lact.
