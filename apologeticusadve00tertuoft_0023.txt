Cyprian‚ Arnobius, and Lactantius. This school was distin-
guished by the cogency of its appeals alike to justice and the
human conscience, the force of· its forensic pleading on behalf
of Christianity, and the keenness of its attack upon paga-
nism ; yet its penetration was ‘somewhat marred by a narrow·
ness of view which regarded all history, all thought, and
all religion, previous to the Advent of Christ as abhorrent:
paganism in every form stood absolutely condemned as
the rival effort of the opponent of God to enslave the
human intellect and deter it fro-m the knowledge of the
Truth. To strip the conscience and mind of man of all
daemoniacal accretions and to confront it, in its simple

the -exact reverse of that pursued by the m‘ore liberal minded
of the Greek Apologists. Carthage and Alexandria repre-

The Alexandrian apologists (e. g. Justin Martyr, Clement,
Origen) adopted a more comprehensive and sympathetic
attitude, and delighted to trace in the philosophy and
history of the past those yearnings after, and approximations
to, the Truth which co'nstituted, in the history of the world,
a preparation for Christianity. Both classes of writers
appealed to the natural conscience and soul of man (see
notes, ch. 17), and for the same purpose,——to elicit its
witness to the Supreme Being 3 but the method of approach
was different. The one saw in the history of pagan thought
nothing but a pernicious falsification and obscuring of the
Divine truth and light; the* other found in it an evidence of
the natural craving of the human for the Divine. So Tertul-

,in common (dev praescr. haer. 7 3 Apol. 46) ; while Origeu and

S. Clement held that the ‘true scribe brings all kinds of
