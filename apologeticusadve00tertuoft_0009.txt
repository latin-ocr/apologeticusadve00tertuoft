PREFAOE.

 

IN preparing this edition of Tertullian’s Apology I
have endeavoured to meet the wants of young theo-
· logical students and to supply such notes as it seemed
likely would prove helpful to them in their study of a
text confessedly difficult in style and abeunding in refer-
ences mythological‚ philosophical‚ historical, and legal.
In respect of style Tertullian is often his own best
interpreter, and references will be found in the notes
to parallel uses of words and constructions in his other
writings which should 116 carefully compared. For the
sake of convenience the composite text printed 111 Migne’s
Patrologia Latina, vol. i. (Paris, 1 844) has been made
13116 116515 of the present edition, but all the important
variant readings have, I hope, been noticed, while some
of them have been preferred 130 13116 text. An account '
of 13116 manuscripts of Tertullian’s writings is given in
the Introduction to the first volume of Oehler's edition, ⁴
and some remarks upon the same subject will be found
in the Preface 130 13116 volume of Tertullian in the Library
of the Fathers (Oxford, 1854).
