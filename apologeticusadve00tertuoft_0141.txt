utique vivunt et mortuis antistant. Recogitant, quousque
vires imperii sui valeant, et ita Deum intelligunt3 adversus

aspects by the Christians. Here it is viewed as holding its position
under the Divine counsels, and the emperor as appointed by God
(ch. 330: in ch. 31, as necessary for the stability of the Church‚ and
(011. 32) its continuance as delaying the end. Yet underneath all this
there lay the feeling that the empire of the world was essentially the
rival and opponent of ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ. See Westcott's essay, ‘ The
Two Empires,’ in his Epist. of S. J olm.

mus tantum, sed etiam expandimus e Dominica passione modulatum,
et orantes confitemur Christo.’ We have seen, ch. 16, that Ohristians
turned to the East in the act of prayer3 and from de coron. 3 and ad
Scap. 4 it appears that they usually prayed in a kneeling posture,
except on the Lord’s Day, and during the fifty days of the season of
‘ Pentecost' ; comp. de orat. 233 and see Canon xx. of Nicaea, with
Bright’s note.

had at their side on occasions of state sacrifices to dictate the exact
formulae (praeeuntes); Plin. N. H. xxxviii. 2. The largesses (con-
giaria, ch. 35), too, which were necessary to elicit acclamations from
the people on the emperor's behalf, were ‘ prompters' of great efficiency.
Tertullian contrasts the perfunctory rites of the heathen with the spont-
aneous prayers of the Christians for the emperor's safety (comp. ch.
395 Clem. Alex. Strom. vii. 6). It is a strange misconception which
sees in his words an argument against prescribed forms of prayer, which
he elsewhere recognize-s (comp. 011. 39; de orat. 1 3 de bapt. 133 de
