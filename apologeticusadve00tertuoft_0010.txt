suggesbed several remarks in fihe Introduoffiorx and
Nosses, The modern literature on Tertullian’s era,
writingS‚ and charaefier is catalogued ab the end of
the articles on Terizuflian in the Dicssionary of Chrisffian
Biography and the Enoyclopaedia Britannica.

‘ohe Clarendon Press for their acceptanee of the work
for publioafiion, and ‘no express my gratitude to the
Rev. Canon Bright, D.D., Regius Professor of Eccle-
siasssical History‚ for his encouragemenh and helpful
